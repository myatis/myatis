- I’m Muhammed Yakup Atış.
- I was born in 1992,Istanbul.
- I'm currently living in Sarıyer/Istanbul.
- I've got my bachelor's degree from Istanbul University in Metallurgy and Materials Engineering.
- I was passionate about computers ever since I know myself. As a child I was dazzled by by how it works .Great author Arthur C. Clarke once said "Magic is just science that we don't understand yet.". And like he said, I always felt like computers works with some kind of magic. After using this technology for many years without really knowing what's going on under the hood,I decided to take a step, jump into this rabbit hole and discover what's in it. I don't know where this road will lead me but I'm surely very exited about this.
